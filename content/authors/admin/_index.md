    summary: |
            My thesis was titled '<i>Evolution and Systematics of the prickly-pears in the Americas: from the field to the genomics</i>', in which I explored various taxonomic, genomic, biogeographic and evolutionary aspects of the cactus genus <i>Opuntia</i> - the prickly-pears. I conducted my research under the supervision of [Profa. Dra. Tatiana T. Souza-Chies](http://lattes.cnpq.br/4127731105834132), from the [Botany Department of Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul](https://www.ufrgs.br/ppgbotanica/), and [Dr. Lucas C. Majure](https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/people/lucas-majure/), from the Florida Museum of Natural History / University of Florida (Gainesville, FL, USA), where I spent a period of seven months as a Visiting Researcher. Several outputs from my thesis have already been published as scientific papers (see 'Publications' tab or bbelow under 'Read Thesis'), but this project has opened an endless avenue of research, with many questions I am still working on and that will be published in due time.

#      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network‚Äôs architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

#    summary: |
#      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## Hello & Welcome to My Page!!
I am an evolutionary biologist best defined as a Botanist. I am currently an Assistant Professor at the Universidade Federal da Fronteira Sul (Erechim, Rio Grande do Sul üáßüá∑). My research focuses on the evolutionary relationships of plants using molecular phylogenetic methods, as well as morphology, cytology, and ecological data to address questions related to biogeographic history, community assembly and diversification, morphological and genome evolution, species origin, and species boundaries within groups. You will find more information browsing this page (under construction), and if you have any questions, don‚Äôt hesitate to contact me!
