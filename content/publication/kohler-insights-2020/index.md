abstract: 'Chloroplast genomes are frequently treated as highly conserved among plants.
  However, many lineages of vascular plants have experienced structural rearrangements,
  including inversions and modifications to the size and content of genes. Cacti are
  one of these lineages, containing the smallest plastome known for an obligately
  photosynthetic angiosperm, including the loss of one copy of the inverted repeat
  and the ndh gene suite, but only a few cacti from the subfamily Cactoideae have
  been characterized. Here, we investigated the variation of plastome sequences across
  the second-major lineage of the Cactaceae, the subfamily Opuntioideae, to address
  1) how variable is the content and arrangement of chloroplast genome sequences across
  the subfamily, and 2) how phylogenetically informative are the plastome sequences
  for resolving major relationships among the clades of Opuntioideae. Our de novo
  assembly of the Opuntia quimilo plastome recovered an organelle of 150,347 bp in
  length with both copies of the inverted repeat and the presence of all the ndh gene
  suite. An expansion of the large single copy unit and a reduction of the small single
  copy unit was observed, including translocations and inversion of genes as well
  as the putative pseudogenization of some loci. Comparative analyses among all clades
  within Opuntioideae suggested that plastome structure and content vary across taxa
  of this subfamily, with putative independent losses of the ndh gene suite and pseudogenization
  of genes across disparate lineages, further demonstrating the dynamic nature of
  plastomes in Cactaceae. Our plastome dataset was robust in resolving three tribes
  with high support within Opuntioideae: Cylindropuntieae, Tephrocacteae and Opuntieae.
  However, conflicting topologies were recovered among major clades when exploring
  different assemblies of markers. A plastome-wide survey for highly informative phylogenetic
  markers revealed previously unused regions for future use in Sanger-based studies,
  presenting a valuable dataset with primers designed for continued evolutionary studies
  across Cactaceae. These results bring new insights into the evolution of plastomes
  in cacti, suggesting that further analyses should be carried out to address how
  ecological drivers, physiological constraints and morphological traits of cacti
  may be related with the common rearrangements in plastomes that have been reported
  across the family.'
