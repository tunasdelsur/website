abstract: 'This data paper presents a largely phylogeny-based online taxonomic backbone
  for the Cactaceae compiled from literature and online sources using the tools of
  the EDIT Platform for Cybertaxonomy. The data will form a contribution of the Caryophyllales
  Network for the World Flora Online and serve as the base for further integration
  of research results from the systematic research community. The final aim is to
  treat all effectively published scientific names in the family. The checklist includes
  150 accepted genera, 1851 accepted species, 91 hybrids, 746 infraspecific taxa (458
  heterotypic, 288 with autonyms), 17,932 synonyms of accepted taxa, 16 definitely
  excluded names, 389 names of uncertain application, 672 unresolved names and 454
  names belonging to (probably artificial) named hybrids, totalling 22,275 names.
  The process of compiling this database is described and further editorial rules
  for the compilation of the taxonomic backbone for the Caryophyllales Network are
  proposed. A checklist depicting the current state of the taxonomic backbone is provided
  as supplemental material. All results are also available online on the website of
  the Caryophyllales Network and will be constantly updated and expanded in the future.
