abstract: The genus Opuntia is one of the most emblematic of the cactus family (Cactaceae)
  and a species-rich clade within subfamily Opuntioideae. After molecular phylogenetic
  studies showed that the traditional broad circumscription of Opuntia could not be
  retained as the genus was polyphyletic, various segregated genera were recognize
  based on both morphological data and phylogenetic studies. Here, we reassessed an
  old and enigmatic taxon, O. schickendantzii, through molecular and morphological
  investigations. Our results support that O. schickendantzii was best circumscribed
  within the Salmonopuntia lineage based on molecular and morphological features.
  As a consequence, a new combination is proposed, and an epitype from the herbarium
  BAF is designated. An updated description of the taxon with illustrations is also
  given.
