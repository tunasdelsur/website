abstract: The name *Cactus tuna* (*Opuntia tuna*) was described by Linnaeus in 1753. Analyses of the original materials have shown that it comprises a heterogeneous assemblage of taxa, likely including elements of what is now recognized as Opuntia dillenii and O. elatior, and the name O. tuna have been historically adopted to an endemic Jamaican species. However, a recent typification of O. tuna using specimens consistent with O. dillenii has led to its treatment as an earlier name, with priority over O. dillenii, while the Jamaican endemic species — previously treated as O. tuna — was described as a new species (O. kingstoniana). Given the widespread and consistent historical use of the name O. dillenii, we advocate for the rejection of Opuntia tuna in order to preserve nomenclatural stability, maintaining the name O. dillenii for the broadly distributed Caribbean taxon, and support the continued use of O. kingstoniana for the Jamaican endemic.
