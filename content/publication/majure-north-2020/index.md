abstract: Opuntia, the most widespread genus of cacti, occurs throughout the Americas
  from Patagonia to Canada. Various species have very wide distributions in the Americas,
  and thus may be considered as both native and aliens. We reexamined data based on
  recent work on the phylogenetics and taxonomy of Opuntia from southern S-America
  and showed that two presumed endemic species to Argentina—O. penicilligera and O.
  ventanensis—are likely derived from, or may be conspecific, with North American
  species. In particular, O. penicilligera is most closely related to members of the
  O. macrorhiza species complex and is morphologically similar to both O. macrorhiza
  and O. cymochila. O. ventanensis shares nearly all vegetative and reproductive morphological
  characters with O. fragilis and likely is conspecific with that taxon. Owed to the
  wide distribution of Opuntia species and the movement of many taxa by people, extra
  care must be exercised when describing new species or for carrying out taxonomic
  treatments. A phylogenetic perspective, as well as a careful study of species across
  the distribution of the genus, is recommended.
