 abstract = {Aloysia dusenii Moldenke (Verbenaceae) is a rheophyte species endemic to South Brazil. The species inhabits riverbanks on rocky outcrops along rivers with swift-running streams. Recent revisions, taxonomic treatments and field work have confirmed the species for South Brazil. In this note, the distribution records of A. dusenii were compiled and a proposal was made to classify the conservation status of this species according to IUCN guidelines. The first photographs of A. dusenii in field were provide for the literature. The importance of including this taxon in the regional lists of endangered flora is emphasized in view of the great threat to their environment coming from dams to hydroelectric projects.},
