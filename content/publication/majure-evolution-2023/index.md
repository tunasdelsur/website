abstract: The formation of the western North American drylands has led to the evolution
  of an astounding diversity of species well adapted for such communities. Complex
  historical patterns often underlie the modern distribution of the flora and fauna
  of these areas. We investigated the biogeography of a group of desert-adapted prickly
  pears, known as the Xerocarpa clade, from western North America. The Xerocarpa clade
  originated in the mid-late Pliocene, likely on the Colorado Plateau, and then moved
  south into the Mojave, Sonoran, and Chihuahuan deserts, and California montane regions,
  further diversifying, mostly into the Quaternary. The southward trajectory of the
  clade was likely greatly influenced by the formation of the Grand Canyon. The synapomorphy
  of dry fruit presumably impeded the long-distance dispersibility of the beavertail
  cactus, Opuntia basilaris, while dry, spiny fruit may have enabled O. polyacantha
  to substantially increase its distribution. Opuntia basilaris evolved a pubescent
  epidermis, allowing it to invade hotter, drier conditions, while the spine-clothed
  stems of O. polyacantha may have given it an advantage for increasing its northern
  range into colder environments. The Xerocarpa clade shows a cold desert origin,
  and changes in morphological characters have made these sister taxa well adapted
  for invading broadscale, but oftentimes contrasting habitats.
