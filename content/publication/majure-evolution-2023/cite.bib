 abstract = {The formation of the western North American drylands has led to the evolution of an astounding diversity of species well adapted for such communities. Complex historical patterns often underlie the modern distribution of the flora and fauna of these areas. We investigated the biogeography of a group of desert-adapted prickly pears, known as the Xerocarpa clade, from western North America. The Xerocarpa clade originated in the mid-late Pliocene, likely on the Colorado Plateau, and then moved south into the Mojave, Sonoran, and Chihuahuan deserts, and California montane regions, further diversifying, mostly into the Quaternary. The southward trajectory of the clade was likely greatly influenced by the formation of the Grand Canyon. The synapomorphy of dry fruit presumably impeded the long-distance dispersibility of the beavertail cactus, Opuntia basilaris, while dry, spiny fruit may have enabled O. polyacantha to substantially increase its distribution. Opuntia basilaris evolved a pubescent epidermis, allowing it to invade hotter, drier conditions, while the spine-clothed stems of O. polyacantha may have given it an advantage for increasing its northern range into colder environments. The Xerocarpa clade shows a cold desert origin, and changes in morphological characters have made these sister taxa well adapted for invading broadscale, but oftentimes contrasting habitats.},
