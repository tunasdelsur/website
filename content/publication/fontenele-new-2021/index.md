abstract: The family Cactaceae comprises a diverse group of typically succulent plants
  that are native to the American continent but have been introduced to nearly all
  other continents, predominantly for ornamental purposes. Despite their economic,
  cultural, and ecological importance, very little research has been conducted on
  the viral community that infects them. We previously identified a highly divergent
  geminivirus that is the first known to infect cacti. Recent research efforts in
  non-cultivated and asymptomatic plants have shown that the diversity of this viral
  family has been under-sampled. As a consequence, little is known about the effects
  and interactions of geminiviruses in many plants, such as cacti. With the objective
  to expand knowledge on the diversity of geminiviruses infecting cacti, we used previously
  acquired high-throughput sequencing results to search for viral sequences using
  BLASTx against a viral RefSeq protein database. We identified two additional sequences
  with similarity to geminiviruses, for which we designed abutting primers and recovered
  full-length genomes. From 42 cacti and five scale insects, we derived 42 complete
  genome sequences of a novel geminivirus species that we have tentatively named Opuntia
  virus 2 (OpV2) and 32 genomes of an Opuntia-infecting becurtovirus (which is a new
  strain of the spinach curly top Arizona virus species). Interspecies recombination
  analysis of the OpV2 group revealed several recombinant regions, in some cases spanning
  half of the genome. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that OpV2 is a novel geminivirus
  more closely related to viruses of the genus Curtovirus, which was further supported
  by the detection of three recombination events between curtoviruses and OpV2. Both
  OpV2 and Opuntia becurtoviruses were identified in mixed infections, which also
  included the previously characterized Opuntia virus 1. Viral quantification of the
  co-infected cactus plants compared with single infections did not show any clear
  trend in viral dynamics that might be associated with the mixed infections. Using
  experimental Rhizobium-mediated inoculations, we found that the initial accumulation
  of OpV2 is facilitated by co-infection with OpV1. This study shows that the diversity
  of geminiviruses that infect cacti is under-sampled and that cacti harbor diverse
  geminiviruses. The detection of the Opuntia becurtoviruses suggests spill-over events
  between viruses of cultivated species and native vegetation. The threat this poses
  to cacti needs to be further investigated.
