abstract: Plastid genomes (plastomes) have long been recognized as highly conserved
  in their overall structure, size, gene arrangement and content among land plants.
  However, recent studies have shown that some lineages present unusual variations
  in some of these features. Members of the cactus family are one of these lineages,
  with distinct plastome structures reported across disparate lineages, including
  gene losses, inversions, boundary movements or loss of the canonical inverted repeat
  (IR) region. However, only a small fraction of cactus diversity has been analysed
  so far.Here, we investigated plastome features of the tribe Opuntieae, the remarkable
  prickly pear cacti, which represent one of the most diverse and important lineages
  of Cactaceae. We assembled de novo the plastome of 43 species, representing a comprehensive
  sampling of the tribe, including all seven genera, and analysed their evolution
  in a phylogenetic comparative framework. Phylogenomic analyses with different datasets
  (full plastome sequences and genes only) were performed, followed by congruence
  analyses to assess signals underlying contentious nodes.Plastomes varied considerably
  in length, from 121 to 162 kbp, with striking differences in the content and size
  of the IR region (contraction and expansion events), including a lack of the canonical
  IR in some lineages and the pseudogenization or loss of some genes. Overall, nine
  different types of plastomes were reported, deviating in the presence of the IR
  region or the genes contained in the IR. Overall, plastome sequences resolved phylogenetic
  relationships within major clades of Opuntieae with high bootstrap values but presented
  some contentious nodes depending on the dataset analysed (e.g. whole plastome vs.
  genes only). Congruence analyses revealed that most plastidial regions lack phylogenetic
  resolution, while few markers are supporting the most likely topology. Likewise,
  alternative topologies are driven by a handful of plastome markers, suggesting recalcitrant
  nodes in the phylogeny.Our study reveals a dynamic nature of plastome evolution
  across closely related lineages, shedding light on peculiar features of plastomes.
  Variation of plastome types across Opuntieae is remarkable in size, structure and
  content and can be important for the recognition of species in some major clades.
  Unravelling connections between the causes of plastome variation and the consequences
  for species biology, physiology, ecology, diversification and adaptation is a promising
  and ambitious endeavour in cactus research. Although plastome data resolved major
  phylogenetic relationships, the generation of nuclear genomic data is necessary
  to confront these hypotheses and assess the recalcitrant nodes further.
