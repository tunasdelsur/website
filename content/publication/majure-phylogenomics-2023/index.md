abstract: Opuntioideae, composed of roughly 370 species, occur in almost every biome
  in the Americas, from seasonally dry tropical forests (SDTF) to high-elevation Andean
  grasslands, American deserts and temperate zones. The interrelationships among the
  three major clades of Opuntioideae (Cylindropuntieae, Opuntieae and Tephrocacteae)
  are not well resolved, and thus, the ancestral habitat, biogeographic history and
  evolution of morphological characters, such as large photosynthetic leaves and flattened
  stems, are poorly understood. To test their geographic origin and evolution of key
  morphological characters, we built the largest phylogenomic dataset for Cactaceae
  to date using 103 plastid genes of 107 taxa of Opuntioideae. The subfamily Opuntioideae
  likely evolved in South America in a combination of seasonally dry tropical forest
  (SDTF)/desert habitats. Opuntieae most likely evolved in South America in SDTF and,
  from there, moved into desert regions, Chaco and temperate/subtropical zones, while
  Tephrocacteae and Cylindropuntieae evolved in South America in desert regions and
  moved into SDTF, Chaco and temperate/subtropical zones. Analyses of morphological
  evolution suggest that, although large leaves are plesiomorphic in Opuntioideae,
  long-lived, photosynthetically active leaves in Cylindropuntieae and Tephrocacteae
  are homoplasious and do not represent retained plesiomorphy, as is often assumed.
  Flattened stems are synapomorphic for Opuntieae, possibly representing adaptation
  to competition for light resources in SDTF, their most likely ancestral area.
