abstract: A phylogenetic study of Uebelmannia investigates the relationships of a
  newly discovered taxon in this enigmatic, early-diverging genus that is sister to
  all the other c. 460 species of tribe Cereeae. Here we present a coalescent-based
  phylogenetic tree inferred with nuclear genes captured by the Cactaceae591 probe
  set encompassing all Uebelmannia species. The new taxon U. nuda is sister to U.
  pectinifera, while U. gummifera and U. buiningii form another pair of closely related
  species. The unusual characteristics of the new cactus (semi-subterranean/geophytic
  habit, turbinate stem, naked areoles) distinguish it from all other Uebelmannia
  species. The definition of the relationships within this early-derived genus endemic
  to the campo rupestre of Minas Gerais State became more evident, and this new find
  adds to the importance of this biogeographic province for the evolution of tribe
  Cereeae. The new species is described, and a preliminary conservation assessment
  is presented. Additionally, a key for all taxa of the genus is provided.
