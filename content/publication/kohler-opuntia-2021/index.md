abstract: Recent studies have shown that a worldwide cultivated plant known as “Lion’s
  Tongue” has been historically and wrongly assigned to another taxon name (Opuntia
  schickendantzii). After a literature study and the examination of herbarium specimens,
  we propose to describe the “Lion’s Tongue” as Opuntia leoglossa sp. nov. Although
  a hybrid origin or artificial selection is speculated, further studies must be carried
  out to better understand this taxon which has a hitherto unknown origin.
