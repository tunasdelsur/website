abstract: Geographical range is one of the critical features for species conservation
  assessment. Nevertheless, species distribution is frequently unknown, undervalued
  or overlooked. During a broad taxonomic and floristic study of the southern South
  American prickly pear species (Opuntia spp.), new records of a species previously
  considered endemic to Argentina have been found in Uruguay and Brazil. Molecular
  phylogenetic inference was carried out to further evaluate the identity of the new
  records, and ecological niche models were implemented to test how the new records
  would fit in the previous known distribution of the species. Through molecular and
  morphological evidence, we confirmed the new records of Opuntia bonaerensis for
  Brazilian and Uruguayan floras and discussed its phylogenetic relationship and morphological
  similarities with closely related species. Our new records uncovered a distribution
  pattern congruent with the Neotropical Peripampasic Orogenic Arc, which must be
  further explored to better determine the biogeographic history of the species. Ecological
  niche models (ENM) revealed that O. bonaerensis likely had a putative ancient distribution
  across the grasslands and shrublands in the Pampean region largely congruent with
  the populations found in Brazil and Uruguay, suggesting relictual Pleistocene populations
  of the species and the role of glacial/interglacial cycles on the distribution of
  the species. In a prospective climate change scenario, ENM suggests that the species
  would in general be more restricted to the southernmost limits of the Pampa region
  and previous outlying records from Mendoza (Argentina) are a putative future refuge
  for O. bonaerensis. The importance of these new records for biodiversity and conservation
  assessment efforts that are ongoing at different scales in Brazil and neighboring
  areas is highlighted.
