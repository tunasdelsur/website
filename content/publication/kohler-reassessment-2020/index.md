abstract: Background and aims – Opuntia is the most widespread genus of Cactaceae,
  naturally occurring throughout arid and semi-arid areas of the Americas. Many of
  the species have taxonomic problems resulting from incomplete original descriptions,
  lack of type designations, a paucity of taxonomic revisions and, in general, difficult
  species delimitation resulting from hybridization, morphological plasticity, and
  poor specimen preparation. However, efforts are being undertaken to fill the gaps
  in our distributional, morphological and phylogenetic knowledge of the group. Here,
  we reassess the name Opuntia canterae, providing an updated description, typification,
  photographs, distribution map, conservation assessment and additional notes. Material
  and methods – Extensive fieldwork was conducted, along with comprehensive herbarium
  and literature review. Morphological characters were assessed based on the commonly
  used characters used for prickly pears. Species delimitation is proposed based on
  our morphological studies, taxonomic and literature revision, as well as preliminary
  phylogenetic studies. The IUCN guidelines were followed to provide a conservation
  assessment of the species.Key results – Opuntia canterae is reassessed as a distinct
  species separated from its previous synonym (O. elata) by the elliptic to long-oblanceolate
  stem segments, acute to conical flower bud apex and long-obconic fruits. An epitype
  is here designated to further clarify the morphological features of the species,
  which, heretofore, were only represented by a photo. The species is considered endemic
  to Uruguay and is provisionally assessed as Endangered (EN) using IUCN criteria,
  but more fieldwork will be necessary to provide a further precise conservation status.
