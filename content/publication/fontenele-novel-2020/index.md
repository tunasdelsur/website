abstract: Cactaceae comprise a diverse and iconic group of flowering plants which
  are almost exclusively indigenous to the New World. The wide variety of growth forms
  found amongst the cacti have led to the trafficking of many species throughout the
  world as ornamentals. Despite the evolution and physiological properties of these
  plants having been extensively studied, little research has focused on cactus-associated
  viral communities. While only single-stranded RNA viruses had ever been reported
  in cacti, here we report the discovery of cactus-infecting single-stranded DNA viruses.
  These viruses all apparently belong to a single divergent species of the family
  Geminiviridae and have been tentatively named Opuntia virus 1 (OpV1). A total of
  79 apparently complete OpV1 genomes were recovered from 31 different cactus plants
  (belonging to 20 different cactus species from both the Cactoideae and Opuntioideae
  clades) and from nine cactus-feeding cochineal insects (Dactylopius sp.) sampled
  in the USA and Mexico. These 79 OpV1 genomes all share textgreater 78.4% nucleotide
  identity with one another and textless 64.9% identity with previously characterized
  geminiviruses. Collectively, the OpV1 genomes display evidence of frequent recombination,
  with some genomes displaying up to five recombinant regions. In one case, recombinant
  regions span ~40% of the genome. We demonstrate that an infectious clone of an OpV1
  genome can replicate in Nicotiana benthamiana and Opuntia microdasys. In addition
  to expanding the inventory of viruses that are known to infect cacti, the OpV1 group
  is so distantly related to other known geminiviruses that it likely represents a
  new geminivirus genus. It remains to be determined whether, like its cactus hosts,
  its geographical distribution spans the globe.
