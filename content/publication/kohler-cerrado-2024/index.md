abstract: Cerrado is a large and heterogeneous ecoregion in the Neotropics marked
  by the fire-prone savanna vegetation, to which succulent lineages are usually not
  associated due to this adverse condition. However, recent studies have highlighted
  the importance of Cerrado as an ancestral range for the origin, dispersal and in
  situ diversification of remarkable lineages of South American cacti. In this perspective,
  we explore the implications of these occurrences in the Cerrado, shedding light
  on a frequently overlooked aspect of this ecoregion—the role of scattered rocky
  outcrop habitats acting as micro-refuges for fire-sensitive lineages. We show that
  most cacti occurrences are associated with patches of rock outcrops across the Cerrado.
  In contrast, when terricolous, a few disparate and not closely related species can
  develop underground structures or present a specialized habit that facilitates their
  presence as a putative response to fire—reinforcing the evolutionary lability of
  fire adaptation in Cerrado lineages. Despite some notable endemisms, several occurrences
  are from species with core distributions in adjacent ecoregions (e.g. Caatinga and
  Chaco), demonstrating the permeability of Cerrado, which can act concomitantly as
  a biogeographical barrier (especially due to its fire-prone habitats) and as a corridor
  for biota interchange. Finally, we stress that Cerrado heterogeneity, often leading
  to different circumscriptions, is a relevant issue when studying and characterizing
  Neotropical biota, which must be further explored and considered to assess the evolutionary
  assembly of the biomes involved.
