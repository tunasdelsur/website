abstract: 'ABSTRACT. In this paper, we present and discuss experiences of the execution
  of the project “Exchange of Knowledge on Peasant Botany”, carried out during 2014
  at the Assentamento Filhos de Sepé (Viamão, RS) with the group “Mulheres da Terra”
  and the Technological Incubator of Popular Cooperatives. An important characteristic
  of the Group is the role of women. Maintainers of knowledge and ancestral practices.
  They become active in all spheres of agriculture production of the settlement. Throughout
  12 meetings, several themes related with agroecological practices with peasant life
  were addressed using different approaches: theoretical, practical and reflexive.
  Based on educational assumptions that value popular knowledge, as well as the horizontality
  of teaching/learning processes, the meetings contributed to the recognition and
  strengthening of the group’s identity of resistance against the current globalized
  agriculture. Likewise, the progress was made in the construction of autonomy in
  the face of techniques and knowledge applied to agroecological production.'
