	abstract = {Aloysia dusenii Moldenke (Verbenaceae) is a rheophyte species endemic to South Brazil. The species inhabits riverbanks on rocky outcrops along rivers with swift-running streams. Recent revisions, taxonomic treatments and field work have confirmed the species for South Brazil. In this note, the distribution records of A. dusenii were compiled and a proposal was made to classify the conservation status of this species according to IUCN guidelines. The first photographs of A. dusenii in field were provide for the literature. The importance of including this taxon in the regional lists of endangered flora is emphasized in view of the great threat to their environment coming from dams to hydroelectric projects.},

In this paper, we present and discuss experiences of the execution of the project “Exchange of Knowledge on Peasant Botany”, carried out during 2014 at the Assentamento Filhos de Sepé (Viamão, RS) with the group “Mulheres da Terra” and the Technological Incubator of Popular Cooperatives. An important characteristic of the Group is the role of women. Maintainers of knowledge and ancestral practices. They become active in all spheres of agriculture production of the settlement. Throughout 12 meetings, several themes related with agroecological practices with peasant life were addressed using different approaches: theoretical, practical and reflexive. Based on educational assumptions that value popular knowledge, as well as the horizontality of teaching/learning processes, the meetings contributed to the recognition and strengthening of the group’s identity of resistance against the current globalized agriculture. Likewise, the progress was made in the construction of autonomy in the face of techniques and knowledge applied to agroecological production.},

	abstract = {Background and aims – Opuntia is the most widespread genus of Cactaceae, naturally occurring throughout arid and semi-arid areas of the Americas. Many of the species have taxonomic problems resulting from incomplete original descriptions, lack of type designations, a paucity of taxonomic revisions and, in general, difficult species delimitation resulting from hybridization, morphological plasticity, and poor specimen preparation. However, efforts are being undertaken to fill the gaps in our distributional, morphological and phylogenetic knowledge of the group. Here, we reassess the name Opuntia canterae, providing an updated description, typification, photographs, distribution map, conservation assessment and additional notes. Material and methods – Extensive fieldwork was conducted, along with comprehensive herbarium and literature review. Morphological characters were assessed based on the commonly used characters used for prickly pears. Species delimitation is proposed based on our morphological studies, taxonomic and literature revision, as well as preliminary phylogenetic studies. The IUCN guidelines were followed to provide a conservation assessment of the species.Key results – Opuntia canterae is reassessed as a distinct species separated from its previous synonym (O. elata) by the elliptic to long-oblanceolate stem segments, acute to conical flower bud apex and long-obconic fruits. An epitype is here designated to further clarify the morphological features of the species, which, heretofore, were only represented by a photo. The species is considered endemic to Uruguay and is provisionally assessed as Endangered (EN) using IUCN criteria, but more fieldwork will be necessary to provide a further precise conservation status.},

	abstract = {Geographical range is one of the critical features for species conservation assessment. Nevertheless, species distribution is frequently unknown, undervalued or overlooked. During a broad taxonomic and floristic study of the southern South American prickly pear species (Opuntia spp.), new records of a species previously considered endemic to Argentina have been found in Uruguay and Brazil. Molecular phylogenetic inference was carried out to further evaluate the identity of the new records, and ecological niche models were implemented to test how the new records would fit in the previous known distribution of the species. Through molecular and morphological evidence, we confirmed the new records of Opuntia bonaerensis for Brazilian and Uruguayan floras and discussed its phylogenetic relationship and morphological similarities with closely related species. Our new records uncovered a distribution pattern congruent with the Neotropical Peripampasic Orogenic Arc, which must be further explored to better determine the biogeographic history of the species. Ecological niche models (ENM) revealed that O. bonaerensis likely had a putative ancient distribution across the grasslands and shrublands in the Pampean region largely congruent with the populations found in Brazil and Uruguay, suggesting relictual Pleistocene populations of the species and the role of glacial/interglacial cycles on the distribution of the species. In a prospective climate change scenario, ENM suggests that the species would in general be more restricted to the southernmost limits of the Pampa region and previous outlying records from Mendoza (Argentina) are a putative future refuge for O. bonaerensis. The importance of these new records for biodiversity and conservation assessment efforts that are ongoing at different scales in Brazil and neighboring areas is highlighted.},

	abstract = {Chloroplast genomes are frequently treated as highly conserved among plants. However, many lineages of vascular plants have experienced structural rearrangements, including inversions and modifications to the size and content of genes. Cacti are one of these lineages, containing the smallest plastome known for an obligately photosynthetic angiosperm, including the loss of one copy of the inverted repeat and the ndh gene suite, but only a few cacti from the subfamily Cactoideae have been characterized. Here, we investigated the variation of plastome sequences across the second-major lineage of the Cactaceae, the subfamily Opuntioideae, to address 1) how variable is the content and arrangement of chloroplast genome sequences across the subfamily, and 2) how phylogenetically informative are the plastome sequences for resolving major relationships among the clades of Opuntioideae. Our de novo assembly of the Opuntia quimilo plastome recovered an organelle of 150,347 bp in length with both copies of the inverted repeat and the presence of all the ndh gene suite. An expansion of the large single copy unit and a reduction of the small single copy unit was observed, including translocations and inversion of genes as well as the putative pseudogenization of some loci. Comparative analyses among all clades within Opuntioideae suggested that plastome structure and content vary across taxa of this subfamily, with putative independent losses of the ndh gene suite and pseudogenization of genes across disparate lineages, further demonstrating the dynamic nature of plastomes in Cactaceae. Our plastome dataset was robust in resolving three tribes with high support within Opuntioideae: Cylindropuntieae, Tephrocacteae and Opuntieae. However, conflicting topologies were recovered among major clades when exploring different assemblies of markers. A plastome-wide survey for highly informative phylogenetic markers revealed previously unused regions for future use in Sanger-based studies, presenting a valuable dataset with primers designed for continued evolutionary studies across Cactaceae. These results bring new insights into the evolution of plastomes in cacti, suggesting that further analyses should be carried out to address how ecological drivers, physiological constraints and morphological traits of cacti may be related with the common rearrangements in plastomes that have been reported across the family.},

	abstract = {Cactaceae comprise a diverse and iconic group of flowering plants which are almost exclusively indigenous to the New World. The wide variety of growth forms found amongst the cacti have led to the trafficking of many species throughout the world as ornamentals. Despite the evolution and physiological properties of these plants having been extensively studied, little research has focused on cactus-associated viral communities. While only single-stranded RNA viruses had ever been reported in cacti, here we report the discovery of cactus-infecting single-stranded DNA viruses. These viruses all apparently belong to a single divergent species of the family Geminiviridae and have been tentatively named Opuntia virus 1 (OpV1). A total of 79 apparently complete OpV1 genomes were recovered from 31 different cactus plants (belonging to 20 different cactus species from both the Cactoideae and Opuntioideae clades) and from nine cactus-feeding cochineal insects (Dactylopius sp.) sampled in the USA and Mexico. These 79 OpV1 genomes all share {\textgreater} 78.4\% nucleotide identity with one another and {\textless} 64.9\% identity with previously characterized geminiviruses. Collectively, the OpV1 genomes display evidence of frequent recombination, with some genomes displaying up to five recombinant regions. In one case, recombinant regions span {\textasciitilde}40\% of the genome. We demonstrate that an infectious clone of an OpV1 genome can replicate in Nicotiana benthamiana and Opuntia microdasys. In addition to expanding the inventory of viruses that are known to infect cacti, the OpV1 group is so distantly related to other known geminiviruses that it likely represents a new geminivirus genus. It remains to be determined whether, like its cactus hosts, its geographical distribution spans the globe.},

Various species have very wide distributions in the Americas, and thus may be considered as both native and aliens. We reexamined data based on recent work on the phylogenetics and taxonomy of Opuntia from southern S-America and showed that two presumed endemic species to Argentina—O. penicilligera and O. ventanensis—are likely derived from, or may be conspecific, with North American species. In particular, O. penicilligera is most closely related to members of the O. macrorhiza species complex and is morphologically similar to both O. macrorhiza and O. cymochila. O. ventanensis shares nearly all vegetative and reproductive morphological characters with O. fragilis and likely is conspecific with that taxon. Owed to the wide distribution of Opuntia species and the movement of many taxa by people, extra care must be exercised when describing new species or for carrying out taxonomic treatments. A phylogenetic perspective, as well as a careful study of species across the distribution of the genus, is recommended.},

	abstract = {Viral metagenomic studies have enabled the discovery of many unknown viruses and revealed that viral communities are much more diverse and ubiquitous than previously thought. Some viruses have multiple genome components that are encapsidated either in separate virions (multipartite viruses) or in the same virion (segmented viruses). In this study, we identify what is possibly a novel bipartite plant-associated circular single-stranded DNA virus in a wild prickly pear cactus, Opuntia discolor, that is endemic to the Chaco ecoregion in South America. Two {\textasciitilde}1.8 kb virus-like circular DNA components were recovered, one encoding a replication-associated protein (Rep) and the other a capsid protein (CP). Both of the inferred protein sequences of the Rep and CP are homologous to those encoded by members of the family Geminiviridae. These two putatively cognate components each have a nonanucleotide sequence within a likely hairpin structure that is homologous to the origins of rolling-circle replication (RCR), found in diverse circular single-stranded DNA viruses. In addition, the two components share similar putative replication-associated iterative sequences (iterons), which in circular single-stranded DNA viruses are important for Rep binding during the initiation of RCR. Such molecular features provide support for the possible bipartite nature of this virus, which we named utkilio virus (common name of the Opuntia discolor in South America) components A and B. In the infectivity assays conducted in Nicotiana benthamiana plants, only the A component of utkilio virus, which encodes the Rep protein, was found to move and replicate systemically in N. benthamiana. This was not true for component B, for which we did not detect replication, which may have been due to this being a defective molecule or because of the model plants (N. benthamiana) used for the infection assays. Future experiments need to be conducted with other plants, including O. discolor, to understand more about the biology of these viral components.},

Here, we integrated fieldwork, collections-based research, morphological observations, molecular systematics, and cytogenetic data to investigate the identity of a previously unidentified taxon of Opuntia (the prickly pear cacti) observed in the north-east region of Argentina, southern South America. Our analyses revealed a cytonuclear phylogenetic discordance among nuclear and plastid genomes, as well as a polyploid nature of the studied taxon. Combining our molecular phylogenetic and cytogenetic analyses with morphological observations, we suggest that hybridization events between the native Opuntia rioplatensis and the North American introduced species, O. ficus-indica, likely produced the taxon here described as O. × cristalensis. Opuntia is the most widespread genus of Cactaceae, and many species have been introduced worldwide for an array of different purposes. Our report proposes the putative first hybridization event in Opuntia between a North American species with a southern South American lineage, which may shed light on more complex evolutionary scenarios, speciation within the group, and the impacts of species introduction.},

	abstract = {The genus Opuntia is one of the most emblematic of the cactus family (Cactaceae) and a species-rich clade within subfamily Opuntioideae. After molecular phylogenetic studies showed that the traditional broad circumscription of Opuntia could not be retained as the genus was polyphyletic, various segregated genera were recognize based on both morphological data and phylogenetic studies. Here, we reassessed an old and enigmatic taxon, O. schickendantzii, through molecular and morphological investigations. Our results support that O. schickendantzii was best circumscribed within the Salmonopuntia lineage based on molecular and morphological features. As a consequence, a new combination is proposed, and an epitype from the herbarium BAF is designated. An updated description of the taxon with illustrations is also given.},

	abstract = {The family Cactaceae comprises a diverse group of typically succulent plants that are native to the American continent but have been introduced to nearly all other continents, predominantly for ornamental purposes. Despite their economic, cultural, and ecological importance, very little research has been conducted on the viral community that infects them. We previously identified a highly divergent geminivirus that is the first known to infect cacti. Recent research efforts in non-cultivated and asymptomatic plants have shown that the diversity of this viral family has been under-sampled. As a consequence, little is known about the effects and interactions of geminiviruses in many plants, such as cacti. With the objective to expand knowledge on the diversity of geminiviruses infecting cacti, we used previously acquired high-throughput sequencing results to search for viral sequences using BLASTx against a viral RefSeq protein database. We identified two additional sequences with similarity to geminiviruses, for which we designed abutting primers and recovered full-length genomes. From 42 cacti and five scale insects, we derived 42 complete genome sequences of a novel geminivirus species that we have tentatively named Opuntia virus 2 (OpV2) and 32 genomes of an Opuntia-infecting becurtovirus (which is a new strain of the spinach curly top Arizona virus species). Interspecies recombination analysis of the OpV2 group revealed several recombinant regions, in some cases spanning half of the genome. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that OpV2 is a novel geminivirus more closely related to viruses of the genus Curtovirus, which was further supported by the detection of three recombination events between curtoviruses and OpV2. Both OpV2 and Opuntia becurtoviruses were identified in mixed infections, which also included the previously characterized Opuntia virus 1. Viral quantification of the co-infected cactus plants compared with single infections did not show any clear trend in viral dynamics that might be associated with the mixed infections. Using experimental Rhizobium-mediated inoculations, we found that the initial accumulation of OpV2 is facilitated by co-infection with OpV1. This study shows that the diversity of geminiviruses that infect cacti is under-sampled and that cacti harbor diverse geminiviruses. The detection of the Opuntia becurtoviruses suggests spill-over events between viruses of cultivated species and native vegetation. The threat this poses to cacti needs to be further investigated.},

	abstract = {Opuntioideae, composed of roughly 370 species, occur in almost every biome in the Americas, from seasonally dry tropical forests (SDTF) to high-elevation Andean grasslands, American deserts and temperate zones. The interrelationships among the three major clades of Opuntioideae (Cylindropuntieae, Opuntieae and Tephrocacteae) are not well resolved, and thus, the ancestral habitat, biogeographic history and evolution of morphological characters, such as large photosynthetic leaves and flattened stems, are poorly understood. To test their geographic origin and evolution of key morphological characters, we built the largest phylogenomic dataset for Cactaceae to date using 103 plastid genes of 107 taxa of Opuntioideae. The subfamily Opuntioideae likely evolved in South America in a combination of seasonally dry tropical forest (SDTF)/desert habitats. Opuntieae most likely evolved in South America in SDTF and, from there, moved into desert regions, Chaco and temperate/subtropical zones, while Tephrocacteae and Cylindropuntieae evolved in South America in desert regions and moved into SDTF, Chaco and temperate/subtropical zones. Analyses of morphological evolution suggest that, although large leaves are plesiomorphic in Opuntioideae, long-lived, photosynthetically active leaves in Cylindropuntieae and Tephrocacteae are homoplasious and do not represent retained plesiomorphy, as is often assumed. Flattened stems are synapomorphic for Opuntieae, possibly representing adaptation to competition for light resources in SDTF, their most likely ancestral area.},

	abstract = {Plastid genomes (plastomes) have long been recognized as highly conserved in their overall structure, size, gene arrangement and content among land plants. However, recent studies have shown that some lineages present unusual variations in some of these features. Members of the cactus family are one of these lineages, with distinct plastome structures reported across disparate lineages, including gene losses, inversions, boundary movements or loss of the canonical inverted repeat (IR) region. However, only a small fraction of cactus diversity has been analysed so far.Here, we investigated plastome features of the tribe Opuntieae, the remarkable prickly pear cacti, which represent one of the most diverse and important lineages of Cactaceae. We assembled de novo the plastome of 43 species, representing a comprehensive sampling of the tribe, including all seven genera, and analysed their evolution in a phylogenetic comparative framework. Phylogenomic analyses with different datasets (full plastome sequences and genes only) were performed, followed by congruence analyses to assess signals underlying contentious nodes.Plastomes varied considerably in length, from 121 to 162 kbp, with striking differences in the content and size of the IR region (contraction and expansion events), including a lack of the canonical IR in some lineages and the pseudogenization or loss of some genes. Overall, nine different types of plastomes were reported, deviating in the presence of the IR region or the genes contained in the IR. Overall, plastome sequences resolved phylogenetic relationships within major clades of Opuntieae with high bootstrap values but presented some contentious nodes depending on the dataset analysed (e.g. whole plastome vs. genes only). Congruence analyses revealed that most plastidial regions lack phylogenetic resolution, while few markers are supporting the most likely topology. Likewise, alternative topologies are driven by a handful of plastome markers, suggesting recalcitrant nodes in the phylogeny.Our study reveals a dynamic nature of plastome evolution across closely related lineages, shedding light on peculiar features of plastomes. Variation of plastome types across Opuntieae is remarkable in size, structure and content and can be important for the recognition of species in some major clades. Unravelling connections between the causes of plastome variation and the consequences for species biology, physiology, ecology, diversification and adaptation is a promising and ambitious endeavour in cactus research. Although plastome data resolved major phylogenetic relationships, the generation of nuclear genomic data is necessary to confront these hypotheses and assess the recalcitrant nodes further.},

	abstract = {The formation of the western North American drylands has led to the evolution of an astounding diversity of species well adapted for such communities. Complex historical patterns often underlie the modern distribution of the flora and fauna of these areas. We investigated the biogeography of a group of desert-adapted prickly pears, known as the Xerocarpa clade, from western North America. The Xerocarpa clade originated in the mid-late Pliocene, likely on the Colorado Plateau, and then moved south into the Mojave, Sonoran, and Chihuahuan deserts, and California montane regions, further diversifying, mostly into the Quaternary. The southward trajectory of the clade was likely greatly influenced by the formation of the Grand Canyon. The synapomorphy of dry fruit presumably impeded the long-distance dispersibility of the beavertail cactus, Opuntia basilaris, while dry, spiny fruit may have enabled O. polyacantha to substantially increase its distribution. Opuntia basilaris evolved a pubescent epidermis, allowing it to invade hotter, drier conditions, while the spine-clothed stems of O. polyacantha may have given it an advantage for increasing its northern range into colder environments. The Xerocarpa clade shows a cold desert origin, and changes in morphological characters have made these sister taxa well adapted for invading broadscale, but oftentimes contrasting habitats.},

	abstract = {Cerrado is a large and heterogeneous ecoregion in the Neotropics marked by the fire-prone savanna vegetation, to which succulent lineages are usually not associated due to this adverse condition. However, recent studies have highlighted the importance of Cerrado as an ancestral range for the origin, dispersal and in situ diversification of remarkable lineages of South American cacti. In this perspective, we explore the implications of these occurrences in the Cerrado, shedding light on a frequently overlooked aspect of this ecoregion—the role of scattered rocky outcrop habitats acting as micro-refuges for fire-sensitive lineages. We show that most cacti occurrences are associated with patches of rock outcrops across the Cerrado. In contrast, when terricolous, a few disparate and not closely related species can develop underground structures or present a specialized habit that facilitates their presence as a putative response to fire—reinforcing the evolutionary lability of fire adaptation in Cerrado lineages. Despite some notable endemisms, several occurrences are from species with core distributions in adjacent ecoregions (e.g. Caatinga and Chaco), demonstrating the permeability of Cerrado, which can act concomitantly as a biogeographical barrier (especially due to its fire-prone habitats) and as a corridor for biota interchange. Finally, we stress that Cerrado heterogeneity, often leading to different circumscriptions, is a relevant issue when studying and characterizing Neotropical biota, which must be further explored and considered to assess the evolutionary assembly of the biomes involved.},
